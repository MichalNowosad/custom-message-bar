# custom-message-bar
## Completed Additional Features
- Message Bar can contain more than two buttons on the bottom and right. This is possible thanks to content projection that was used while implementing this functionality. The main purpose of this approach, was making the component more flexible, in case there would be one day a use case, where more than two buttons would be needed on either side.
- Added custom stylesheet for buttons, that would be also reusable across other components

## Not Completed Additional Features
- Adding a service, responsible for displaying Message Bar in the overlay
- Exporting the Message Bar component to the library
